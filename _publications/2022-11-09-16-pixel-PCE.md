A 16-pixel interdigitated photoconductive emitter has been demonstrated to produce THz beams with electrically controlled polarisation states, including azimuthal, radial, and linear. Changing the polarisation state has been achieved electrically by altering the bias voltage applied to individual pixels, which allowed bypass mechanical realignment. 

To determine the optimal bias configuration for azimuthal and radial polarisation states, the dipole array modelling was conducted.

To confirm the generation of cylindrical-vector (azimuthal and radial) beams, the spatially-resolved electro-optic sampling has been used.

Both azimuthal and radial beams possess unique features, that make them applicable in fields of trapping and accelerating particles, as well as improved spatial resolution for imaging applications.
