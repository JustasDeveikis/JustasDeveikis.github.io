We studied Ruddlesden-Popper phase layered perovskite (2-thiophene-methylammonium lead iodide) to investigate the influence of temperature on structural and optoelectronic properties. There was a structural phase transition occurring at 220 K that was observed in three different temperature-dependent measurements: X-ray diffraction, UV-visible absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy.

The structural phase transition altered the tilt pattern of inorganic (lead iodide) octahedra, which in turn modified the Pb and I orbital overlap, as a result affecting absorption and PL emission spectra. Furthermore, an additional PL peak emerged at temperatures below 220 K, which we assigned to defect-bound exciton emission.

The findings reported in this study improve our understanding of the connection between the structure and optoelectronic properties, which could help to develop ways to alter the functional properties of layered perovskites in a desired way.
